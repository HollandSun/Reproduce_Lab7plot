## Kansas COVID-19 Mask Mandate Visualization
This repository reconstructs and examines the a controversial chart

## Data Source
The original chart did not come with a publicly available dataset. However, a subsequent CDC study (Van Dyke et al., 2020) published in MMWR used the same underlying data and cited USAFacts as the source for county-level case and population data. 
The 24 mask-mandate counties were identified from the footnotes of that paper, based on classification by the Kansas Health Institute (KHI).

Cases: https://static.usafacts.org/public/data/covid-19/covid_confirmed_usafacts.csv

Population: https://static.usafacts.org/public/data/covid-19/covid_county_population_usafacts.csv

County classification: Van Dyke et al. (2020), MMWR

## Scripts
*prepare_data.R*

Downloads raw county-level COVID-19 case data and population data from USAFacts, filters for Kansas counties from July 5 to August 3, 2020, calculates daily new cases from cumulative counts, and classifies each county as "Mask" or "No Mask" based on the CDC paper. Outputs a clean CSV file (kansas_usafacts_jul05_aug03_2020.csv).

*plot_ggplot.R*

Reads the CSV generated by the first script, aggregates data by mask mandate group, calculates per 100K rates and 7-day rolling averages, and produces plot:

## Result
The final replicated figure is saved in the "misleading_plot.png" file and almost perfectly reproduces the results presented in Lab 07.
